This file contains .net framework specific properties, items and targets. They are factored into a Microsoft.NETFramework.targets and Microsoft.NetFramework.props

<Project DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
   <!-- 
        In VS 2010 SP1 and VS 2012, both supported for asset compatibility, the MSBuild installed 
        as part of them did not enforce using the local ToolsVersion (4.0) in all cases, but instead 
        just used whatever ToolsVersion was in the project file if it existed on the machine, and 
        only forced 4.0 if that ToolsVersion did not exist.  

        Moving forward, we do want to enforce a single acting ToolsVersion per version of Visual Studio, 
        but in order to approximate this behavior on VS 2010 SP1 and VS 2012 as well, we've redirected 
        the targets:  If we're building using 4.X MSBuild (which doesn't define the new reserved 
        property, MSBuildAssemblyVersion), we'll point right back at the 4.0 targets, which still exist 
        as part of the .NET Framework.  Only if we're using the new MSBuild will we point to the current
        targets.
