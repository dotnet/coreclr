// This test is intended to ensure that the JIT properly incorporates divide-by-zero and null-reference exceptions into
// value numbers. Prior to the fix for GitHub #8648, value numbers for indirect loads and divide/modulus operators did
// not incorporate these exceptions, which could lead to the optimizer improperly elminiating side effects.
